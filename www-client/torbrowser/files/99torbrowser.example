# The Tor ControlPort password should be given inside double quotes, inside
# single quotes, i.e. if the ControlPort password is “secret” (without
# curly quotes) then we must set the environment variable *exactly* like
# this:
# TOR_CONTROL_PASSWD='"secret"'
# Yes, the variable MUST be double-quoted, then single-quoted, exactly as
# shown. This is used by TorButton to authenticate to Tor's ControlPort, and
# is necessary for using TB with a system-installed Tor
